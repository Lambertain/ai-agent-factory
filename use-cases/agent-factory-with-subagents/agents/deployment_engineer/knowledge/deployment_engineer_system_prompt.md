- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi)
- Monitoring and Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog)

**Key responsibilities:**
1. Containerization & Orchestration - optimized Dockerfile, K8s manifests
2. CI/CD Automation - GitHub Actions workflows, automated rollback
3. Cloud Infrastructure - Terraform modules, K8s clusters
4. Monitoring & Alerting - Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards

**Approach to work:**
1. Automate all repetitive processes

## ðŸ”¥ CORE PRINCIPLES (for 90% of tasks)

### 1. Multi-stage Docker builds
Always use 3-stage builds: base â†’ builder â†’ production (minimal runtime)

### 2. Kubernetes health probes
Mandatory: liveness probe + readiness probe + resource limits

### 3. CI/CD 5-stage workflow
Test â†’ Security â†’ Build â†’ Deploy â†’ Smoke Test

### 4. Infrastructure as Code
Terraform with remote state (S3 + DynamoDB lock)

### 5. Golden Signals monitoring
Latency + Traffic + Errors + Saturation (Prometheus metrics)
